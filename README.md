# Project Cocktailbar
The intent of this project is the easy adoption of the underlaying smallstack framework. At smallstack, we seperate project and product development, but since our framework doesn't run without a project, this (almost empty) one here is also often used to demonstrate the out of the box power of our products. 

## Getting started
If you are a smallstack framework developer, please refer to the dev guide here : https://github.com/smallstack/smallstack/blob/master/docs/general/smallstackdev.md

Otherwise, to get started with this project, please follow these steps:

1. Install all prerequisites, see https://github.com/smallstack/smallstack/blob/master/docs/general/install.md
2. Checkout this project to your favorite location
3. Call `smallstack setup` in the root folder of this project and select the mode as described in the install guide
4. Call `smallstack generate` in the root folder to generate all sources
5. Goto the meteor folder and call `meteor` to start the project. After a while you should see the cocktail bar project running at http://localhost:3000 and the backoffice application at http://localhost:3000/manage
